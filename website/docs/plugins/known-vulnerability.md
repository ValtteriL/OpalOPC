## Synopsis

The server contains known vulnerabilities.

## Description

The target server contains one or multiple publicly known vulnerabilities. As the vulnerabilities are public information, any attacker can exploit them to cause damage to the server. The severity of the issues and the damage an attacker can cause depend on the vulnerabilities.

This plugin works by searching the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) for the software used by the target server. It uses the NVD API but is not endorsed or certified by the NVD.

## Solution

Look for remediation advice for each of the CVE codes online, or contact the vendor of the server for help.
